                <p>Normal Attack: Perform up to 6 consecutive shots with a bow.<br><br>
                    Charged Attack: Perform a more precise Aimed Shot with increased DMG. While aiming, the power of
                    Hydro will accumulate on the arrowhead. An arrow fully charged with the torrent will deal Hydro DMG
                    and apply the Riptide status.<br><br>
                    Riptide: Opponents affected by Riptide will suffer from AoE Hydro DMG effects when attacked by
                    Tartaglia in various ways. DMG dealt in this way is considered Normal Attack DMG.<br><br>

                    Riptide Flash: A fully-charged Aimed Shot that hits an opponent affected by Riptide deals
                    consecutive bouts of AoE DMG. Can occur once every 0.7s.<br><br>
                    Riptide Burst: Defeating an opponent affected by Riptide creates a Hydro burst that inflicts the
                    Riptide status on nearby opponents hit.

                    Unleashes a set of weaponry made of pure water, dealing Hydro DMG to surrounding opponents and
                    entering Melee Stance.<br><br>
                    In this Stance, Tartaglia's Normal and Charged Attacks are converted to Hydro DMG that cannot be
                    overridden by any other elemental infusion and change as follows:<br><br>
                    Normal Attack: Perform up to 6 consecutive Hydro strikes.<br><br>
                    Charged Attack: Consumes a certain amount of Stamina to unleash a cross slash, dealing Hydro
                    DMG.<br><br>
                    Riptide Slash: Hitting an opponent affected by Riptide with a melee attack unleashes a Riptide Slash
                    that deals AoE Hydro DMG. DMG dealt in this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG, and can only
                    occur once every 1.5s.<br><br>
                    After 30s, or when the ability is unleashed again, this skill will end. Tartaglia will return to his
                    Ranged Stance and this ability will enter CD. The longer Tartaglia stays in his Melee Stance, the
                    longer the CD. If the return to a ranged stance occurs automatically after 30s, the CD is even
                    longer.

                    applying the Riptide status. Returns a portion of its Energy Cost after use.<br><br>
                    Melee Stance: Light of Obliteration: Performs a slash with a large AoE, dealing massive Hydro DMG to
                    all surrounding opponents, which triggers Riptide Blast.<br><br>
                    Riptide Blast: When the obliterating waters hit an opponent affected by Riptide, it clears their
                    Riptide status and triggers a Hydro Explosion that deals AoE Hydro DMG. DMG dealt in this way is
                    considered Elemental Burst DMG.
