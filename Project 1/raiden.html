                    The Raiden Shogun unveils a shard of her Euthymia, dealing Electro DMG to nearby opponents, and
                    granting nearby party members the Eye of Stormy Judgment.<br><br>

                    Eye of Stormy Judgment<br><br>

                    When characters with this buff attack and deal DMG to opponents, the Eye will unleash a coordinated
                    attack, dealing AoE Electro DMG at the opponent's position.<br><br>
                    Characters who gain the Eye of Stormy Judgment will have their Elemental Burst DMG increased based
                    on the Energy Cost of the Elemental Burst during the Eye's duration.<br><br>
                    The Eye can initiate one coordinated attack every 0.9s per party.
                    Coordinated attacks generated by characters not controlled by you deal 20% of the normal DMG.

                    Gathering truths unnumbered and wishes uncounted, the Raiden Shogun unleashes the Musou no Hitotachi
                    and deals AoE Electro DMG, using Musou Isshin in combat for a certain duration afterward. The DMG
                    dealt by Musou no Hitotachi and Musou Isshin's attacks will be increased based on the number of
                    Chakra Desiderata's Resolve stacks consumed when this skill is used.<br><br>
                    Musou Isshin<br><br>
                    While in this state, the Raiden Shogun will wield her tachi in battle, while her Normal, Charged,
                    and Plunging Attacks will be infused with Electro DMG, which cannot be overridden. When such attacks
                    hit opponents, she will regenerate Energy for all nearby party members. Energy can be restored this
                    way once every 1s, and this effect can be triggered 5 times throughout this skill's
                    duration.<br><br>
                    While in this state, the Raiden Shogun's resistance to interruption is increased, and she is immune
                    to Electro-Charged reaction DMG.<br><br>
                    While Musou Isshin is active, the Raiden Shogun's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG will be
                    considered Elemental Burst DMG.<br><br>
                    The effects of Musou Isshin will be cleared when the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.<br><br>
                    Chakra Desiderata<br><br>
                    When nearby party members (excluding the Raiden Shogun herself) use their Elemental Bursts, the
                    Raiden Shogun will build up Resolve stacks based on the Energy Cost of these Elemental
                    Bursts.<br><br>
                    The maximum number of Resolve stacks is 60. The Resolve gained by Chakra Desiderata will be cleared
                    300s after the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.
